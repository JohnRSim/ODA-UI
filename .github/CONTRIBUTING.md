Hi! I'm John. I love to innovate and collaborate with talented developers who like to stretch the capabilities of the web to build cutting edge and engaging experiences. I'd also love to hear your suggestions for improving this project. Thanks for your interest in the project. Could I ask you to take a look at the project's Code of Conduct before continuing with your contribution? Thanks! A good starting point for getting up-to-speed on the project is the README file.
